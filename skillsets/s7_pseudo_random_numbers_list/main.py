    # global variable, __name__, in module is entry point to program, that is, '__main__'. Otherwise, it's the name you import the module by.
    # Code under if block will only run if module is entry point to your program.
    # It allows code in module to be importable by other modules, without executing code block beneath on import.

    # In short, use 'if __name__ == "main" 'block to prevent (certain) code from being run when the module is imported.
    # Put simply, __name__ is a variable defined for each script that defines whether the script is being run as the main module or as an imported module.

    # Executes main() function only if this file is executed as the main program.


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
